(default javascript behaviour)
javascipt is 
    synchronus- one code execution at a time 
    single threaded - it is a slow language but it dosent feel like a slow lang
                      cause u dont ever use js engine alone, it is mostly used with other run time environments(browser,nodejs eg)

execution context-execute one line at a time    
                  conssits of call stack and memory heap 

blocking code vs non-blocking code  
1) block the flow of program  2)does not block execution

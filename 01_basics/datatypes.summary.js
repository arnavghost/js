//datatypes are divvided into two types based on how the data is stored in memory and how it accessed

// primitive : call by value
//7 types: string,number,boolean,null,undefined,symbol,BigInt


//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
// This means that variable types are determined at runtime, not at compile time, allowing variables to hold values of different types throughout their lifetime

//reference type (non-primitie type)
//array,objects,function

//type of if use on these then object type will be returned. for function it will object function



//****************Mmemory************** */

//Stack (Primitive) , Heap (Non-primitive)
//in stack u get the copy of the variable and in heap u get the reference so if u change the value the original value will be changed
